/*

Given an integer array 'nums', return the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence.

A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from an array by deleting some or no elements without 
changing the order of the remaining elements. 

Example 1:
	Input: nums[] = [10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]
	Output: 4
	Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [2,3,7,101], therefore the length is 4.

Example 2:
	Input: nums[] = [0,1,0,3,2,3]
	Output: 4
