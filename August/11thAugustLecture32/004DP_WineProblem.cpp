Given n wines in a row, with integers denoting the cost of each wine respectively. Each year you can sell the 
first or the last wine in the row. However, the price of wines increases over time. 

Let the initial profits from the wines be [p_1, p_2, ... , p_n]. In the yth year, the profit from 
the kth wine will be y*p_k.
